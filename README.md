Welcome to the Studies In Implementing Support for CAPT Printers!

This is just a repository for miscellaneous experiments, tools and tips
dedicated to an ongoing goal of implementing a *superior*<sup>Â®</sup>
alternative driver for CAPT-only Canon laser printers.

Here's a rundown on what's in here:

### [docs](docs) (Docs and Notes)
First and foremost, this is the place for study notes documenting research
on CAPT printers, improvement of captdriver, test procedures and other
miscellaneous information.

### [capt.lua](capt.lua) (CAPT/USB Dissector for Wireshark)
A Lua dissector which annotates CAPT commands in packet captures in Wireshark.

To use the dissector for a single Wireshark session, run this command in a
directory containing ``capt.lua``:

```bash
$ wireshark -X lua_script:capt.lua
```

Other ways of adding Lua dissectors are explained in [Chapter 10](https://wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/wsluarm.html) of the Wireshark Developer Guide.

The dissector currently only dissects packets over USB. CAPT over Ethernet and
parallel printer/IEEE 1284 ports are currently not supported.

### [in2pbmp4.sh](in2pbmp4.sh) (Input to PBM P4 Image Script)
A script originally created to help visualise arbitrary data as a PBM P4
image. Currently obsolete and due for an improvement. For now a `printf`
and a `dd` is probably more usable:

```sh
# Example for 200x200 1bpp image
printf "P4\n200 200\n" > example.pbm
dd if=input.bin bs=$((200 * 200 / 8)) count=1 >> example.pbm   # PROTIP: '>>' for appending, NOT '>'
```

The format is like:
```sh 
printf "P4\n200 200\n" > $OUTPUT_FILE
dd if=$INPUT_FILE bs=$((200 * 200 / 8)) count=1 >> $OUTPUT_FILE
```

Try `/dev/urandom` as an input file for a start!

### [sample\_balls.py](sample_balls.py) (Performance Test Page Generator)
A Python script to generate test pages of varying complexity in SVG format, in
order to test rasteriser and compressor performance.

```bash
# Generate an A4-sized page filled with 16x16 grey ellipses
$ ./sample_balls.py --size a4 --balls-per-row 16 --mode grey > test_a4_grey.svg

# Generate a US Letter-sized page filled with 2x2 gradient-filled ellipses
$ ./sample_balls.py --size letter --mode bw-radial-gradient > test_letter_grads.svg
```

Run `./sample_balls.py --help` for a list of options.

Pages with a few grey ellipses are simple and therefore easy to process, while
pages filled with thousands of radial gradient-filled ellipses pose a formidable
challenge at larger sizes and higher resolutions.

### [sample\_blots.py](sample_blots.py) (RLE Test Page Generator)
A Python script to generate images for analysis of RLE algorthms. This script was
originally created to study the Smart Compression Architecture (SCoA) algorithm
used by select late-1990s and early-2000s Canon laser printers. It may be used
for analysing other RLE codecs as well.

PBM P4 and PGM P5 output formats are supported.

```bash
# Generate a 1-bit, 600dpi A4-sized image with pixel runs of different length
$ ./sample_blots.py --mode mirrored-incr-runs --size=a4 --resolution 600 --format p4 --out_file test.pbm

# Alternative example using stdout
# (WARNING: ordinary files will be overwritten without warning)
$ ./sample_blots.py --mode mirrored-incr-runs --size=a4 --resolution 600 --format p4 > test.pbm
```

Run `./sample_blots.py --help` for a list of options.

### [scoa.py](scoa.py) (SCoA Toolkit)
A Python module containing a SCoA decompressor among other utilities for
decompressing SCoA images or print data. The decompressor should work,
but has not yet been thoroughly validated.

See also [Issue #33](https://github.com/agalakhov/captdriver/issues/33)
on the original captdriver repo for details.

```python
from scoa import SCoADecoder

# Create a decoder object for a 596-byte wide bitmap
decoder = SCoADecoder(596)
```

Have fun!
