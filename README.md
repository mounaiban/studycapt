Welcome to the Studies In Implementing Support for CAPT Printers!

This is just a repository for miscellaneous experiments, tools and tips dedicated
to an ongoing goal of implementing a *superior*Â® alternative driver for CAPT-only
Canon laser printers.

For now, there's just the following items:

### capt.lua (Wireshark CAPT Dissector)
A Lua dissector which annotates CAPT commands in packet captures in Wireshark.

To use the dissector for a single Wireshark session, run this command in a directory containing ``capt.lua``:
```
$ wireshark -X lua_script:capt.lua
```

The dissector is currently only able dissect packets over USB. CAPT over Ethernet and parallel printer port/IEEE1284 are currently not supported.

### find\_msb()
An experiment in improving ``find_msb()``, a function in ``hiscoa-compress.c`` that finds the position of an integer's highest bit, similar to Python's ``int.bit_length()``.

To run the benchmarks:
```
$ python -im find_msb
>>> benchmark()
```
To benchmark with 64-bit and 128-bit numbers:
```
>>> sample_64 = get_sample(100000, 64)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_64, sizeof=8)
...
>>> sample_128 = get_sample(100000, 128)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_128, sizeof=16)
```

### in2pbmp4.sh
A script to make PBM P4 images from files, by basically slapping a PBM P4 header
onto an excerpt of the first bytes of a file. PBM P4s are eight times as compact
as a P1, and are recommended when there is no need to tinker with individual bits.

Assuming that ``in2pbmp4.sh`` is already marked as executable with
``chmod +x`` or any alternative method:

```
# Visualise the first (104*80)/8 bytes of a file:
$ ./in2bpmp4 104 80 your_file > visp4.pbm
```

### sample\_balls.py
A script to generate print test pages in SVG format.

```
# Generate an A4-sized page filled with 16x16 grey ellipses
$ ./sample_balls --size a4 --balls-per-row 16 --mode grey > test_a4_grey.svg

# Generate a US Letter-sized page filled with 2x2 gradient-filled ellipses
$ ./sample_balls --size letter --mode bw-radial-gradient > test_letter_grads.svg

```

Have fun!
