Welcome to the Studies In Implementing Support for CAPT Printers!

This is just a repository for miscellaneous experiments, tools and tips dedicated
to an ongoing goal of implementing a *superior*Â® alternative driver for CAPT-only
Canon laser printers.

For now, there's just two items:

* ``find_msb.py``, an experiment in trying to improve ``find_msb()``

* ``bytes2pbm``, a command line tool to generate 1-bit Portable Bitmaps
  (specifically, PBM P1 images). Includes an importable function, ``bytes_to_pbm()``

### Running the find\_msb() Benchmarks
```
$ python -im find_msb
>>> benchmark()
```
To benchmark with 64-bit and 128-bit numbers:
```
>>> sample_64 = get_sample(100000, 64)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_64, sizeof=8)
...
>>> sample_128 = get_sample(100000, 128)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_128, sizeof=16)
```

### Using bytes2pbm
Assuming that ``bytes2pbm.py`` is already marked as executable with
``chmod +x bytes2pbm.py`` or any alternative method:

```
# inputs should be (w*h)/8 bytes long, bytes will be ignored or padded
# if the input length is not correct

# visualise a file as a 104x100x1bpp bitmap
$ ./bytes2pbm 104 100 your_file > vis.pbm

# enter text to be visualised as a 16x16 bitmap
$ ./bytes2pbm 16 16 - > message.pbm

# you cannot crib from RNGs as random bytes can be mistaken as malformed strings
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=800 | ./bytes2pbm 80 80 -
...
UnicodeDecodeError: ....

# instead, output such streams to a separate file:
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=800 of=random.bin
$ ./bytes2pbm 80 80 random.bin > random.pbm

```
Have fun!
