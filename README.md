Welcome to the Studies In Implementing Support for CAPT Printers!

This is just a repository for miscellaneous experiments, tools and tips
dedicated to an ongoing goal of implementing a *superior*<sup>Â®</sup>
alternative driver for CAPT-only Canon laser printers.

For now, there's just the following items:

### [capt.lua](capt.lua) (CAPT/USB Dissector for Wireshark)
A Lua dissector which annotates CAPT commands in packet captures in Wireshark.

To use the dissector for a single Wireshark session, run this command in a
directory containing ``capt.lua``:

```bash
$ wireshark -X lua_script:capt.lua
```

Other ways of adding Lua dissectors are explained in [Chapter 10](https://wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/wsluarm.html) of the Wireshark Developer Guide.

The dissector currently only dissects packets over USB. CAPT over Ethernet and
parallel printer/IEEE 1284 ports are currently not supported.

### [find\_msb()](find_msb.py)
An experiment in improving ``find_msb()``, a function in ``hiscoa-compress.c``
that finds the position of an integer's highest bit, similar to Python's
``int.bit_length()``.

To run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ python -im find_msb
```

To benchmark with 64-bit and 128-bit numbers:

```python
>>> benchmark()
>>> sample_64 = get_sample(100000, 64)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_64, sizeof=8)
...
>>> sample_128 = get_sample(100000, 128)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_128, sizeof=16)
```

### [in2pbmp4.sh](in2pbmp4.sh) (Input to PBM/P4 Image Script)
A script to make PBM P4 images from any file, by slapping a PBM P4 header onto
an excerpt of the first bytes of a file.

Assuming that ``in2pbmp4.sh`` is already marked as executable with
``chmod +x`` or any alternative method:

```bash
# Visualise the first 1040 (i.e. 104x80/8) bytes of a file as a 104x80px image:
$ ./in2bpmp4 104 80 binary_file > visp4.pbm

# Create an A4-sized random 1bpp image (at 600dpi) for compression tests
# Note: the name of the file containing random bits is repeated at two places
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=random-a4.bin bs=100 count=347944 && ./in2pbmp4 4970 7014 random-a4.bin > random-a4.pbm
```

You can easily create 1-bit (pseudo-)random noise images with this script, these
are not compressible by conventional compression algorithms. Such images may be
used for studying out-of-memory behaviours of printers.

### [sample\_balls.py](sample_balls.py) (Performance Test Page Generator)
A script to generate test pages of varying complexity in SVG format, in order
to test rasteriser and compressor performance.

```bash
# Generate an A4-sized page filled with 16x16 grey ellipses
$ ./sample_balls --size a4 --balls-per-row 16 --mode grey > test_a4_grey.svg

# Generate a US Letter-sized page filled with 2x2 gradient-filled ellipses
$ ./sample_balls --size letter --mode bw-radial-gradient > test_letter_grads.svg
```

Pages with a few grey ellipses are simple and therefore easy to process, while
pages filled with thousands of radial gradient-filled ellipses pose a formidable
challenge at larger sizes and higher resolutions.

Have fun!
