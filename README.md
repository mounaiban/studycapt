Welcome to the Studies In Implementing Support for CAPT Printers!

This is just a repository for miscellaneous experiments, tools and tips dedicated
to an ongoing goal of implementing a *superior*Â® alternative driver for CAPT-only
Canon laser printers.

For now, there's just ``find_msb.py``, an experiment in trying to improve
``find_msb()``. It contains benchmarks and re-implementations of the function,
examined in Python.

### Running the Benchmarks
```
$ python -im find_msb
>>> benchmark()
```
To benchmark with 64-bit and 128-bit numbers:
```
>>> sample_64 = get_sample(100000, 64)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_64, sizeof=8)
...
>>> sample_128 = get_sample(100000, 128)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_128, sizeof=16)
```
Have fun!
