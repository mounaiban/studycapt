Welcome to the Studies In Implementing Support for CAPT Printers!

This is just a repository for miscellaneous experiments, tools and tips dedicated
to an ongoing goal of implementing a *superior*Â® alternative driver for CAPT-only
Canon laser printers.

For now, there's just the following items:

### find\_msb()
An experiment in improving ``find_msb()``, a function in ``hiscoa-compress.c`` that finds the position of an integer's highest bit, similar to Python's ``int.bit_length()``.

To run the benchmarks:
```
$ python -im find_msb
>>> benchmark()
```
To benchmark with 64-bit and 128-bit numbers:
```
>>> sample_64 = get_sample(100000, 64)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_64, sizeof=8)
...
>>> sample_128 = get_sample(100000, 128)
>>> benchmark(sample=sample_128, sizeof=16)
```

### bytes2pbm
A script to make PBM P1 images from standard input or files, visualising it
as a 1-bpp bitmap.

Assuming that ``bytes2pbm.py`` is already marked as executable with
``chmod +x bytes2pbm.py`` or any alternative method:

```
# inputs should be (w*h)/8 bytes long, bytes will be ignored or padded
# if the input length is not correct

# visualise a file as a 104x100x1bpp bitmap
$ ./bytes2pbm 104 100 your_file > vis.pbm

# enter text to be visualised as a 16x16 bitmap
$ ./bytes2pbm 16 16 - > message.pbm

# you cannot crib from RNGs as random bytes can be mistaken as malformed strings
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=800 | ./bytes2pbm 80 80 -
...
UnicodeDecodeError: ....

# instead, output such streams to a separate file:
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=800 of=random.bin
$ ./bytes2pbm 80 80 random.bin > random.pbm

```

### in2pbmp4.sh
A script to make PBM P4 images from files, by basically slapping a PBM P4 header
onto an excerpt of the first bytes of a file. PBM P4s are eight times as compact
as a P1, and are recommended when there is no need to tinker with individual bits.

Assuming that ``in2pbmp4.sh`` is already marked as executable with
``chmod +x`` or any alternative method:

```
# Visualise the first (104*80)/8 bytes of a file:
$ ./in2bpmp4 104 80 your_file > visp4.pbm
```

### sample\_balls
A script to generate print test pages in SVG format.

```
# Generate an A4-sized page filled with 16x16 grey ellipses
$ ./sample_balls a4 16 grey > test_a4_grey.svg

# Generate a US Letter-sized page filled with 8x8 gradient-filled ellipses
$ ./sample_balls letter grey-radial-gradient > test_letter_grads.svg

```

Have fun!
